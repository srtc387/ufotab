# How to Publish This Project to GitHub

Follow these steps to share your UFO Flap game on GitHub:

## Step 1: Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to https://github.com and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Give your repository a name (e.g., "ufo-flap")
4. Optionally add a description like "A 3D UFO flying game built with React and Three.js"
5. Keep it public (unless you want it private)
6. **Important**: Don't initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license since we already have these
7. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Local Repository to GitHub

After creating the repository, you'll see instructions. Follow these steps in your terminal:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```bash
   cd "c:\Users\srtcs\ufo-flap (4)"
   ```

3. Add the GitHub repository as a remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME.git
   ```
   Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username and YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME with the name you gave your repository.

4. Rename the branch to main (if needed):
   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   ```

5. Push your code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Step 3: Verify Your Upload

1. Refresh your GitHub repository page
2. You should now see all your code files
3. The README.md file will be displayed as the main page content
4. You can now share the repository URL with others

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Make sure you have git installed and configured
- Check that you're using the correct repository URL
- If you get authentication errors, consider using a personal access token instead of your password
- If you get branch name conflicts, you might need to adjust the branch naming commands

Once completed, your game will be accessible to anyone with the GitHub link!
